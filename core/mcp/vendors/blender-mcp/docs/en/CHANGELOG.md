# Changelog

All notable changes to Blender MCP will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Unity / Quest game-engine FBX export** — `blender_export_fbx` now exposes full
  axis/transform control and a `unity_static_preset` flag for non-rigged
  props/environments. The preset applies the settings required for a clean Unity
  import (`axis_forward=-Z`, `axis_up=Y`, `use_space_transform`,
  `bake_space_transform` so the mesh imports with a zeroed Transform / no residual
  -90deg X rotation, `mesh_smooth_type=FACE`, Mesh/Empty object types). New params:
  `axis_forward`, `axis_up`, `use_space_transform`, `bake_space_transform`,
  `apply_unit_scale`, `mesh_smooth_type`, `object_types`, `path_mode`. Defaults are
  backward-compatible (Blender FBX defaults) unless the preset/params are set.
- **docs/UNITY_QUEST_EXPORT.md** — mobile-VR (Quest) export checklist: poly budgets,
  origin/axis rules, the static preset, and tri-count verification.
- **Zero-Transform export guard** — `blender_export_fbx` now auto-zeros each
  exported object's `.location` under `bake_space_transform` (then restores it)
  so props import into Unity at (0,0,0), and warns on unapplied rotation/scale.
  Controlled by `zero_transform_for_export` (default True). The export result
  reports `zeroed_for_export` and `warnings`. Prevents a baked-translation
  defect class where layout-positioned objects imported metres off-origin.
- **`blender_verify_fbx`** — re-imports an exported FBX and asserts game-engine
  readiness: world origin (0,0,0), triangle budget, one-object-per-file,
  material/emissive report. Returns PASS/FAIL so a modeling agent can
  self-verify each export instead of post-hoc bulk QA.
- **`blender_get_object_info(include_transform_check=True)`** — adds a
  `unity_ready` block (world translation, location/rotation/scale identity
  flags, `will_import_at_origin`, notes) that reveals a baked-translation
  footgun `mesh_stats` can't.
- **automation skill** workflow guide: added a "Game-engine export (Unity / Quest VR)"
  section.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- **Blender 5.x hard-crash and view-layer fixes** (verified: live suite now 121/121 against Blender 5.0.1)
  - `modifier_apply`, `boolean`, decimate: replaced `bpy.ops.object.modifier_apply`
    (hard-crashes from the addon server thread in 5.x) with a depsgraph
    `new_from_object` data-API helper
  - `boolean`: BOOLEAN modifier now added with viewport display off by default
    to avoid crash-on-redraw in heavy scenes; depsgraph apply when `apply=True`
  - `set_origin` and `apply_transform`: rewritten to pure vertex/matrix math
    (no `bpy.ops`), fixing crashes and view-layer errors
  - Added `select_only()` / `ensure_object_mode()` helpers in `handlers/compat.py`
    that link objects to the scene master collection and select via the data
    API; applied across `uv`, `physics`, `rigging`, `modeling` handlers
  - `armature_create` and object `duplicate` now link to the scene master
    collection so new objects are always in the active view layer
