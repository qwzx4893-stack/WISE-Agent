PR Review Prompt Template

This module contains the prompt template used by the OpenHands agent
for conducting pull request reviews. The template uses skill triggers:
- {skill_trigger} will be replaced with '/codereview' or '/codereview-roasted'
- /github-pr-review provides instructions for posting review comments via GitHub API

The template includes:
- {diff} - The complete git diff for the PR (may be truncated for large files)
- {pr_number} - The PR number
- {commit_id} - The HEAD commit SHA
- {review_context} - Previous review comments and thread resolution status
"""

# Template for when there is review context available
_REVIEW_CONTEXT_SECTION = """
## Previous Review History

The following shows previous reviews and review threads on this PR.
Pay attention to:
- **Unresolved threads**: These issues may still need to be addressed
- **Resolved threads**: These provide context on what was already discussed
- **Previous review decisions**: See what other reviewers have said

{review_context}

When reviewing, consider:
1. Don't repeat comments that have already been made and are still relevant
2. If an issue is still unresolved in the code, you may reference it
3. If resolved, don't bring it up unless the fix introduced new problems
4. Focus on NEW issues in the current diff that haven't been discussed yet
"""

_EVIDENCE_REQUIREMENT_SECTION = """
## PR Description Evidence Requirement

Require the PR description to include an `Evidence` section (or similarly labeled section) showing that the code actually works.

When checking the PR description:
- For frontend or UI changes, require a screenshot or video that demonstrates the implemented behavior in the actual product.
- For backend, API, CLI, or script changes, require the command(s) used to run or exercise the real code path end-to-end and the resulting output.
- Unit tests alone do **not** count as evidence. Do not accept `pytest`, unit test output, or similar test runs as the only proof that the change works.
- If the change appears to come from an agent conversation or AI-assisted workflow, prefer a conversation link such as `https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/{conversation_id}` so reviewers can trace the work.
- Do not accept vague claims like "tested locally" without concrete runtime artifacts, commands, or output.

If the change is substantive and this evidence is missing or weak, call it out as a must-fix issue in your review. Do not invent evidence that is not present in the PR description.
